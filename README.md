# Doctor-Appointment-Site


## üìå Project Overview
The **Doctor Appointment System** is a web-based or mobile application that allows patients to book appointments with doctors efficiently. The system provides an easy-to-use interface for scheduling, managing, and tracking medical appointments while ensuring seamless communication between doctors and patients.

## üöÄ Features
- **User Authentication**: Patients and doctors can register and log in securely.
- **Appointment Booking**: Patients can book appointments.
- **Doctor Availability**: Doctors can set their available time slots.
- **Appointment Notifications**: Email reminders for undifinished making appointment process:
  (Assumptions): If user selects a day and time and goes to other page a pop up shows ups with choices for reminder. If user wants to be reminded system sends an email. 
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage users, doctors, and appointments.
- **Search & Filtering**: Patients can find doctors based on specialty, location.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML / CSS / Javascript
- **Backend**: .Net Web API Project
- **Database**: MySQL(before deployment)/ Azure SQL Server and Database (after deployment) / MongoDB (for commentService) 
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth / Firebase Auth
- **Deployment**: Azure, CloudAMPQ

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Context

The **Doctor Appointment System** is designed as a **microservices-based architecture** with a modular approach, ensuring scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. The system consists of the following backend services:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Doctor Appointment System (Core Backend)**
- Manages **users**, **doctors**, **appointments**, and **availability**.
- Handles authentication, role-based access control, and appointment logic.
- Stores and retrieves data from a relational database (Azure SQL Database).
- Exposes RESTful APIs for frontend and API Gateway interactions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Doctor Appointment System API Gateway**
- Acts as a central entry point for all requests to the system.
- Handles authentication, request routing, and load balancing.
- Implements **rate limiting** and **security mechanisms**.
- Aggregates data from multiple backend services.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Comment Service**
- Manages patient feedback and doctor reviews.
- Stores comments in a **NoSQL database** (MongoDB) for fast retrieval.
- Ensures moderation and spam detection for user-generated content.
- Provides an independent RESTful API that integrates with the API Gateway.

### üîó **Service Communication**
- **Internal Communication:** Microservices communicate using **REST APIs** or **gRPC**.
- **Data Storage:**
  - **Relational DB (Azure SQL Database)** for structured appointment data.
  - **NoSQL DB (MongoDB/Redis)** for comments and fast caching.
- **Security:**
  - **JWT-based authentication** for secure API calls.
  - **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for user permissions.
  - **API Gateway security** for centralized access control.

### üöÄ **Deployment & Scaling**
- **Containerized using Docker** for easy deployment and management.
- **Kubernetes (K8s) or Docker Swarm** for orchestration in production.
- **CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing and deployment.
- **Cloud-based deployment** (Azure) for high availability.

This architecture ensures a **modular**, **scalable**, and **efficient** Doctor Appointment System, separating concerns and optimizing performance.
